fixed_arch = [0 1 2 3 4(c_prev) , 1 0 2 2 1 , 3 1 4 2 1, 5 2 6 2 0, 0 1 7 0 1, 7]
Out = identity(8)

ptyhon file where you define arch seq , then this python file creates only this graph, train it 
construct it in incremental way, with id operation only! 5 layers, only one sampled layer with identity function


Abstract , Introduction (problem description, novelty of this paper, neural net approaches specially sequence techniques,we are interested in 
if this LSTM is really the optimal approach or not, some words about NAS and ENAS, This is one and half pages

Previous work: (NAS and ENAS previous work. and why do we think it is not enough, previous sequence modelling with NN (reminder : balint will send a paper),
)

Proposed work: (Theory itself, no measurements or implementations, system design, equations, seach space how did we expand it. no datasets description(

Evaluation: (define the concrete things, num of layers, operations, datasets, hyperparameters)

Results ( measurements, perplexity, loss, prove or disprove our initial assumption, computational complexity, training time ,etc(

conclusions or summary
